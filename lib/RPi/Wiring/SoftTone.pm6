#`[ WiringPi includes a software-driven sound handler capable of outputting a simple
    tone/square wave signal on any of the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins.

    There are some limitations… To maintain a low CPU usage, the minimum pulse width
    is 100μS. That gives a maximum frequency of  1/0.0002 = 5000Hz.

    Also note that while the routines run themselves at a higher and real-time
    priority, Linux can still affect the accuracy of the generated tone.

    However, within these limitations, simple tones on a high impedance speaker or
    piezo sounder is possible.

    To use:

        #include <wiringPi.h>
        #include <softTone.h>

    When compiling your program you must include the pthread library as well as the
    wiringPi library:

        cc -o myprog myprog.c -lwiringPi -lpthread

    You must initialise wiringPi with one of wiringPiSetup(),  wiringPiSetupGpio()
    or wiringPiSetupPhys() functions. wiringPiSetupSys() is not fast enough, so
    you must run your programs with sudo.

    Some expansion modules may also be fast enough to handle software PWM – it has
    been tested with the MCP23S17 GPIO expander on the PiFace for example.

    The following two functions are available:
]

#`[ This creates a software controlled tone pin. You can use any GPIO pin and the
    pin numbering will be that of the wiringPiSetup() function you used.

    The return value is 0 for success. Anything else and you should check the global
    errno variable to see what went wrong.  ]
    int softToneCreate (int pin) ;


#`[ This updates the tone frequency value on the given pin. The tone will be played
    until you set the frequency to 0.  Notes

    Each pin activated in softTone mode uses approximately 0.5% of the CPU.  You
    need to keep your program running to maintain the sound output! ]
    void softToneWrite (int pin, int freq) ;
